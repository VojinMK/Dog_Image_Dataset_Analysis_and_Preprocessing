# Dog Image Dataset – Analysis and Preprocessing 

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook created as part of the PPPO course project.  
The main goal of the project is to work with a small dataset of dog images and demonstrate how to load, explore, and preprocess image data in Python.

The notebook goes through several typical steps when working with image datasets:
- loading and displaying dog images
- basic preprocessing (resizing, cropping, converting to grayscale, etc.)
- simple analysis of image properties
- preparing the data for potential further use in machine learning or computer vision tasks

Although the project is focused on a relatively small dataset, it clearly shows the complete workflow — from raw image files to cleaned and structured data ready for further experimentation.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Common data and image processing libraries (e.g. NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Pillow / OpenCV)

## Project Structure

- `PPPO_Projekat_IT21_2021.ipynb` – main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code, explanations, and results
